Problem 1: mkdir cs3308 && cd cs3308
Problem 2: mv cs3308 csci3308; cd
Problem 3: cp filename copyoffile
Problem 4: rm copyoffile
Problem 5: mkdir tmp && rmdir tmp; cat file.txt
Problem 6: open file.txt
Problem 7: head file.txt
Problem 8: tail file.txt
Problem 9: grep -rn "the" ./*     //NOTE: Will recursively search all files under wd
Problem 10: find `pwd` -name books.txt
Problem 11: zip -r dir.zip && unzip dir.zip -d tmp && tar -zcvf dir.tar tmp 
		&& rm -rf tmp && mkdir tmp && tar -C ./tmp -xvf dir.tar
Problem 12: touch filename

STEP 5:
Problem 1: sort passwd.txt //NOTE: I named my file passwd.txt
Problem 2: sort -n -k 3 -t ":" passwd.txt
Problem 3: sort -n -k 4 -k 3 -t ":" passwd.txt
Problem 4: grep -n "Marx" passwd.txt
Problem 5: wc -l passwd.txt
Problem 6: wc -l passwd.txt > tmp
Problem 7: chmod a+x ./getLines.sh  
					 Running `./getLines.sh` runs the program. This is because global 
					 executable binaries should be stored under a directory in the PATH
					 env variable, and this one is not. Other commands:
					 chmod 777 ./getLines.sh
